# Computer simulations with experiments for Physics labs

A set of laboratory classes to be taught as a part of a 1-year calculus-based Physics class. It is composed out of 7 modules designed to bring together experiments and computer simulations (numerical simulations). Each module uses both simulations and experiments to address a phenomena under study, and lasts for 3 weeks (21 weeks total for the whole set). Wolfram Mathematica is used for computer simulations. Topics are: Motion with a drag, Pendulum with an arbitrary amplitude, Magnus effect, Centripetal force acting on a pendulum, A ball rolling from paths of various shapes, Doppler shift and Fourier transformation, Equipotential lines.
